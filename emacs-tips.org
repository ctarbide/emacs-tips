** Info Pages
Info pages are a rich and reliable source of information.
- =C-h i= :: open info directory
- =TAB= :: next link
- =S-TAB= :: previous link
- =c= :: copy name of the current info node
- =M-x info-apropos= :: search in the indices of all manuals
- =?= :: open summary of all info commands
- =d= :: go to info directoy
- =m= :: go to a menu item
- =s= :: regexp search document

- =I= :: search in the indices of current manual
- =n= :: next
- =p= :: previous
- =u= :: up
- =t= :: top
- =q= :: quit (selects previous buffer)

Searching goes through multiple Info nodes, see [[info:info#Search Text][(info) Search Text]] for
more information.
** Text Searching
- =C-s= :: incremental search forward
- =C-r= :: incremental search backward
- =C-M-s= :: incremental search forward (regular expression)
- =C-M-r= :: incremental search backward (regular expression)

** Lisp evaluation
- =M-:=
- =C-x C-e=
- =C-M-x=
- =M-x ielm=
- =M-x eshell=

You really should known what each of these do, also remember that =C-h
k= is a great friend.
** Eshell
- =M-p= :: previous command (match prefix)
- =M-n= :: next command (match prefix)
- =C-c C-c= :: eshell-interrupt-process
- =C-c C-p= :: eshell-previous-prompt

- =C-c C-l= :: eshell-list-history
* File Variables
File variables are important to select and customize major and minor
modes in a file-by-file basis, see [[info:emacs#Specifying File Variables][Specifying File Variables]]

How to access/examine/inspect file variables? <elisp:(symbol-value
'file-local-variables-alist)>, this variable may be nil, as it is best
practice to remove them as they are consumed by their handling modes.

** Examples
*** Lord of the Rings (from org4beginners, see references)
My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
   1. this was already my favorite scene in the book
   2. I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
   1. on DVD only
   He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
   - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
                    him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
*** Text Markups
You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and
~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike-through+.

** Configuration
*** Change default workflow states
Add this to your initialization script:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "WONTDO" "DONE")))
#+end_src
*** Add timestamp when tasks are DONE
#+begin_src conf
  ,#+STARTUP: logdone
#+end_src
*** Add nice indentation and other configurations
#+begin_src conf
  ,#+STARTUP: indent logdone
#+end_src
** Evaluation of Code Blocks

=C-s=, =C-r=, =C-f=, =C-d=, =C-e=, =C-j= are really useful, learn how
to use them.
